As part of a study on water resource management, Lu et al (1999) present data on seven-day streamflow rates 
(in 〖ft〗^3/s) over a series of streams in west-central Florida. 
To model two-year recurrence flow, four possible hydrological predictor variables were collected. 
x_i1=drainage area (m^2) , 
x_i2=basin slope (ft/m), 
x_i3=soil-infiltration index (inches), 
and x_i4=rainfall index (inches).
